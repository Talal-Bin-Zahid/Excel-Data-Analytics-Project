This repository contains a comprehensive data visualization project focused on analyzing key customer demographics, income trends, and purchase behavior related to vehicle sales (specifically cars and bikes). The dashboard provides insights into how gender, occupation, commute distance, and age bracket correlate with purchasing decisions, serving as an executive summary for sales and marketing strategy.
📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) & Metrics
The analysis relies on the following core metrics and KPIs:
 * Average Income per Purchase: Measured in USD.
 * Count of Purchased Bike: Binary metric ('Yes' or 'No').
 * Customer Commute Distance: Measured in miles, categorized into brackets (0-1, 1-2.5, 2.5-5, 5-10, More than 20).
 * Number of Individuals: Absolute count of customers.
 * Number of Cars by Occupation: Car purchase count segmented by Occupation (Clerical, Management, Manual, Professional, Skilled Manual).
 * Customer Age Bracket: Categorical breakdown (Adolescent, Adult, Old).
✨ Data Analysis & Key Findings
1. Average Income Per Purchase (Gender & Bike Purchase)
This chart compares the average income of customers based on their gender and whether they purchased a bike.
 * Average Income for Bike Purchasers ('Yes'):
   * Male customers who purchased a bike ('Yes') have the highest average income at $60,124.
   * Female customers who purchased a bike ('Yes') have an average income of $55,774.
 * Average Income for Non-Bike Purchasers ('No'):
   * Male customers who did not purchase a bike ('No') have an average income of $56,208.
   * Female customers who did not purchase a bike ('No') have the lowest average income at $53,440.
 * Key Insight: For both genders, the average income for customers who purchased a bike ('Yes') is higher than for those who did not ('No').
2. Customer Commute (Count of Purchased Bike)
This line chart tracks the count of customers who did and did not purchase a bike across different commute distance brackets.
 * In the 0-1 Miles bracket, customers who did not purchase a bike (No) outnumber those who did (Yes), with approximately 210 'No' vs. 190 'Yes'.
 * The 1-2.5 Miles bracket shows the lowest overall count of bike purchases.
 * For the 5-10 Miles bracket, the number of customers who purchased a bike ('Yes') slightly exceeds those who did not ('No').
 * In the More than 20 Miles bracket, the count of non-bike purchasers ('No') significantly increases, while the count of bike purchasers ('Yes') drops to its lowest point (approximately 50).
3. Number of Cars By Occupation
This stacked bar chart details the volume of car purchases across five major occupation categories. Car purchases are segmented into four unspecified categories (1, 2, 3, 4).
 * Skilled Manual is the occupation with the highest overall number of individuals (total purchases across all car categories), with the majority falling into car category '1'.
 * Professional is the second-highest category, with a strong distribution across all four car categories, particularly category '1' and category '2'.
 * Clerical has a high volume, predominantly in car category '1' (approximately 80 individuals).
 * Management has the lowest overall count of individuals/purchases.
4. Customer Age Bracket
This line chart compares the count of bike purchases ('Yes' vs. 'No') across three age brackets.
 * The Adult age bracket represents the overwhelming majority of all purchases, peaking at approximately 400 individuals for non-bike purchases ('No') and over 300 individuals for bike purchases ('Yes').
 * The Adolescent and Old brackets have significantly lower purchase volumes, both peaking below 100 individuals.
 * In the Adult bracket, the count of customers who did not purchase a bike ('No') is greater than the count of those who did ('Yes').
 * The Old age bracket shows the lowest total volume of purchases overall.
